# stockMarketPredictionTool
This is an Excel based automated tool developed by me which extensively uses D3.Js, R, Excel VBA and Phantom JS to provide an integrated appication that not only automatically fetches the data from the web but also develops models, creates interactive hovering data label charts on excel and also test the accuracy of the predictions just at the click of a button. Though the models are very basic, the automation mechanism is effective and can be used by people who still want to rely on basic excel apps for stock data analytics. Demo of the tool available here: https://youtu.be/VBx7Ik6aw7c
